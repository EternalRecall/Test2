Hi Team,

We are sending synthetic sample files to validate our insider-risk detection tooling. Attached files contain clearly marked test data (marker: dlptest123). Treat these files as test artefacts only — do not upload to production services or payment gateways.

Quick actions required:
- Confirm receipt of the test files.
- Confirm that detection rules trigger on the marker string dlptest123.
- Share any false positives or misses found during validation.

Regards
Security Team
